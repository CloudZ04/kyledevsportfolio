                                <li>A WordPress Elementor website that was re-designed for a modern look and feel.</li>
                                <li>Built using WordPress and Elementor, with some custom CSS & JavaScript.</li>

                            <p>While in college & university I had the opportunity to work on a client project for Action Against Stalking (AAS),
                                where I contributed to design, development, and content structure with another student.</p>
                            <p>The CEO (our client) felt the original website was outdated, and was in need of updating. 
                                We decided the colour scheme to match the brand theme of the charity based on their logo, 
                                and created a new website that was more modern and user-friendly, while portraying the charity's values and mission.</p>

                            <p>I was also responsible for the design of a brand new logo for the 'Centre for Action Against Stalking' which I designed
                                using Adobe Illustrator, taking inspiration from the charity's main logo, and values.</p>

                                <li>Built a personal game tracking site</li>
                                <li>Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & MySQL</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>GameTracker.gg was just a personal project that I created to track upcoming games that had already, or 
                                been scheduled to release within the 2025-2026 period. Although now I have re-developed the site to hold 
                                many more games going back as far as 30 years ago as I wanted to use the site as a personal collection.</p>

                            <p>I am a gamer myself. I love story games, I love the competitiveness some games bring (such as VALORANT), and
                                it's just an escape for me. So I decided to create a site that would benefit myself, but thought of other gamers as
                                they would be the target audience. Thankfully it paid off and this project got me an A for my HND!
                            </p>
                            <p>The site uses API integration and a PHP and MySQL based back-end for manual database editing. This includes
                                fetching data, searching, manual insertion, deletion, and editing of data. The site also has a friends and messaging 
                                system now as I wanted to try build something new. As of now, the site is not live, and I'm unsure if it ever will 
                                be as a site like this requires a lot of work and maintenance, especially with new games being released every day. 
                                Maybe in the future.

                            <p>I should have probably created a portfolio when I started my journey as a developer, but I didn't. So I decided it was time!
                                The website follows a sort of... GitHub-like design with the minimalistic dark theme, with one colour as the main highlight.
                            </p>
                            <p>I also made the logo for the website! I never did quite know what to do with it as my name starts with a K, quite an odd letter
                                to build into designs, but with some creativity, I decided on something modern, clean, and unique. The wonders of what 20 
                                minutes in Illustrator can do.
