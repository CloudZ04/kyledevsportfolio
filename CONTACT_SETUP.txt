CONTACT FORM SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================

Your contact form is now set up to use PHP (no signups needed!).

STEP 1: Edit contact.php
-------------------------
Open contact.php and change this line:
    $to = "your-email@example.com";

Replace "your-email@example.com" with your actual email address.


STEP 2: Configure XAMPP Mail (Optional)
----------------------------------------
By default, XAMPP doesn't have mail configured. You have two options:

OPTION A - Test Locally (emails won't actually send):
   Just use it as-is. The form will work, but emails won't send.
   You can check the form data by viewing $_POST in contact.php

OPTION B - Configure XAMPP to send real emails:
   1. Open: C:\xampp\php\php.ini
   2. Find and edit these lines:
      [mail function]
      SMTP = smtp.gmail.com
      smtp_port = 587
      sendmail_from = your-email@gmail.com
      sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
   
   3. Open: C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.ini
   4. Edit these lines:
      smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
      smtp_port=587
      auth_username=your-email@gmail.com
      auth_password=your-app-password
      force_sender=your-email@gmail.com
   
   5. Restart Apache in XAMPP


STEP 3: Test the Form
----------------------
1. Make sure XAMPP Apache is running
2. Go to http://localhost/portfolio-site/
3. Fill out the contact form
4. Click "Send Message"
5. You should see a success message


ALTERNATIVE: When you deploy your site online
----------------------------------------------
Most web hosts have mail() already configured and working.
Just upload your files and it should work automatically!


Questions? The form is already working - it just needs your email address in contact.php!
