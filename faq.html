<h2>frequently asked questions</h2>
<p>Most of these are not set in stone and can be negotiated - this is just to ensure we both have realistic
   expectations of the project you wish to undertake.</p>

      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>Consultation - What should I expect?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>First and foremost, consultation is free. However, it is important to note that the consultation is not a guarantee I will
           accept your project. If you have applied for a consultation through my contact form, I will get back to you as soon as possible and we
           can arrange a time that is convenient for both of us.</p>
        
        <p><strong>In-person, call, or email?</strong></p>
        <p>I don't have an office, therefore I cannot offer in-person consultations. However, I can offer consultation via call or email:</p>
        
        <ul class="faq-list">
          <li><strong>Call (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Discord):</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Great option for those who prefer to discuss their project over the phone or video call</li>
              <li>Please provide a link to a document discussing the details of your project</li>
              <li>Video or voice? Completely up to you - I understand some people aren't comfortable with video calls</li>
              <li>If we are using Teams or Discord, informal messages are more than welcome, however, please do not use this
                  as official communication for the project.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Email:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Perfect for those who prefer written communication or are shy like myself. Each accepted project will have a
                unique inbox for communication regarding the project - I suggest using the same method to keep all communication in one place
                if your Mailing Application allows.</li>
              <li>Allows you to provide detailed information about your project (preferably in a Word Document or similar)</li>
              <li>During the consultation phase, if you have not replied to an email within 48 hours, I will send a reminder to your inbox. 
                If there has been no response within 7 days, I will assume you are not interested in the consultation and will not 
                pursue the project further.
              </li>

      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>How does pricing and payment work?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Prices vary depending on the scope of the project. Once we work out the details of your project, you 
            will be given a quote for the project. To help with this you should provide me with as much information as possible
            about your project, including your budget and timeline, as this will help me to give you a more accurate quote.
            <br><br>
            If you disagree with the quote and want to discuss changes, we can do so during the consultation phase; after consultation, 
            the quote will remain the same unless additional work is required in which case, the quote will go up. Once you have agreed 
            to the quote, you will be required to pay a deposit of <strong>30% of the total project cost</strong>. This is to cover for early 
            cancellation fees and is non-refundable. The remaining <strong>70% will be due upon completion of the project</strong>.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What if I (the developer) cancels the project?</strong>
            As you know, sometimes life can get in the way and I may need to delay or cancel the project and take a step back. If this does happen we will
            discuss the situation about a possible delay. If you or I decide to cancel the project, you will be refunded the deposit paid in full.

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p><b>Discussion:</b> We'll discuss the details of your site and your needs. Once I have a clear
            understanding of your project, I will conduct some further research over the next few days and 
            get back to you with a quote.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Design:</b> If you have agreed to the quote, I'll design and build the home page first. This is for you
            to review and ask for any required changes regarding content and style before I continue with the rest of the site.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Build:</b> Once you're happy with the styling of the home page, I can build the rest of the site in the same style.</p>

        <span>What am I responsible for?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>You are responsible for all the content on the site. This includes pages, text, images, videos, and any other media. This is
          not only to help me, but also help you. While I will build the site and do research into your brand and industry, you are the best person
          for this job.
          <br><br>
          <p>You are also responsible for getting a domain and hosting for the site. This is to ensure the site is online and accessible to your audience, as well as
            ensuring the site is entirely yours, and not my own as I do not offer hosting services at this time. As this is more technical, I will be happy to do this for you
            if you give the necessary information, however, the final payment will have to be made before the site is launched.</p>

      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>What if I don't like my site or change my mind?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>There's nothing wrong with not liking the site I have designed, or changing your mind altogether about the project. However, please do be aware of the following: 
          <ul class="faq-list">
            <li><strong>Don't like the site currently?</strong></li>
            <li>I will work with you to make changes to the site until you are 100% satisfied. It would be helpful if you could provide me with a list of
              changes you want to make, and any other relevant information.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>You changed your mind?</strong></li>
            <li>If you have changed your mind and no longer want to continue with the project, that's okay! However, you will be charged for the work that has been done so far.
              For example, if you have paid £1200 GBP for the website, and I have completed 30% of the project, then you will be charged £360 GBP. This is to cover my time
              and the resources used to build the site.
            </li>
            
          </ul>

      </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        <span>How long does it take to build my site?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Websites are complex and are unique to each project. This also depends on the tools and technologies that are used. 
           However, I can give you rough estimates based on the scope of the project. 
           <br><br>
           If I were designing, then coding the site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
          <br>
          <p><b style="color: #feffb0;">One page website:</b> 1-2 weeks</p>
          <p><b style="color: #feffb0;">Multi-page website:</b> 2-4 weeks</p>
          <p><b style="color: #feffb0;">E-commerce website:</b> 4-8 weeks</p>
          <br>
           Again, these are not promises, and may change depending on the scope of the project. Regarding timeline, I will be as
           transparent as possible and keep you updated on the progress of the project every few days (unless agreed differently).

        <span>What will you use to build my site?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I will use the tools and technologies that are best suited for the project. This will be discussed during the consultation phase.
           Most sites I have built use HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and PHP. React and Next.js can also be used if preferred. For sites such as e-commerce websites, I may use a CMS such as WordPress.
           <br><br>
           That said, if you have any preferences to the tools and technologies used, I will be happy to discuss these with you during the consultation.

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>I have split this into 3 parts as it is very long. The 'Must have' section is required for any project. The other two are to simply 
          help me understand more about your project and needs.<br>
          I will need the following information to build your site:
          <ul class="faq-list">
            <li><strong>Must have:</strong></li>
            <li>Your brand and industry (including logo if applicable)</li>
            <li>Your target audience (Who the site is for and what they need to do on it)</li>
            <li>Your competitors (Helps identifying opportunities and avoiding copying what already exists)</li>
            <li>Your content (Text, images, videos, etc.)</li>
            <li>Your project goals and objectives (What you want to achieve with the site)</li>
            <li>Your timeline for the project (Any fixed deadlines or launch dates)</li>
            <li>Your estimated budget for the project (Helps scope features appropriately and helps with estimating pricing)</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Nice to have:</strong></li>
            <li>Your design preferences (Examples of websites you like and dislike)</li>
            <li>Your previous website(s) (If applicable - please provide links to the website)</li>
            <li>Your brand font(s) (If applicable - otherwise I will choose a suitable font for your brand)</li>
            <li>Your brand colour(s) (Websites often use 60% neutral/background colour, 30% for your structural/brand colour, 10% for call-to-action/accent colours. If no colours are given, I will choose suitable options for you to choose from.) </li>
            <li>Functionality requirements (Forms, booking systems, payments, user accounts, administrative tools to manage the site, etc. If none of these requirements are given, they will not be implemented.)</li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Advanced / Protections:</strong></li>
            <li>SEO considerations (Keywords, meta descriptions, alt text, etc.)</li>
            <li>Analytics and tracking (Google Analytics, etc.)</li>
            <li>Legal requirements (Privacy policy, cookie banner, accessibility requirements (e.g. WCAG))</li>
          </ul>
          Please note that any legal requirements such as the privacy policy, may be dependent by country and industry, and should be reviewed by a legal professional before being implemented.

        <span>What happens after the project is complete?</span>
        <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>You will be given the final invoice for the remaining cost of the project. Once the payment has been made, you will be given
           all the necessary files and documentation to manage the site yourself. This will include the source code, images, videos, and any other media used in the project.
           <br><br>
        <p><strong>What if it is a WordPress website?</strong></p>
        <p>This will depend on the chosen method of building the WordPress site. If it is client-owned hosting, then admin access will just be handed back over to you
           as this is your host. If the site is developed locally or on a temporary environment, it will be transferred to your chosen hosting provider once complete,
           and full administrator access will be provided at handover. 
           <br><br>
           Once the project is complete, responsibility for the website, including hosting, updates, security and maintenance, is fully transferred to you.
        </p>
           Basic documentation will be provided to help you manage the site. As WordPress is a widely used platform, there are also many high-quality resources
           available online, and it is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the system to get the most out of your website.
